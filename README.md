# employee_directory


## Introduction

*  As a student developer,  the project was to create a employee directory with React. 

## Table of Contents
1.  Description
2.  Techologies

## Description:

* As a user, the user should be able to view entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information.

*  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

*  The user should be able to:

    * Sort the table by at least one category

    * Filter the users by at least one property.
